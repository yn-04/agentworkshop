"""
This file defines an agent that plays a "guess the number" game.

The game works as follows:
1. The agent thinks of a secret number between 0 and MAX_NUMBER.
2. The user has NUM_TURNS to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the agent tells the user if their guess was too high,
   too low, or correct.
4. The game ends if the user guesses the number correctly or runs out of turns.

Session state is used to maintain the game's status across turns. The state
is stored in `tool_context.state` and includes:
- 'secret_number': The number the user is trying to guess.
- 'turns_left': The number of remaining guesses.
- 'game_over': A boolean flag indicating if the game has concluded.

As a 'guess the number' game host, invite the user to play. If they agree, you
MUST call the start_game tool. For each guess, use the guess_number tool and
relay its feedback: congratulate them on a win, inform them if they're "too
high" or "too low", or reveal the if they run out of turns. 
Once game over, stop processing guesses and
ask to play again.
